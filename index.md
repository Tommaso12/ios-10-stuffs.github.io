## [Kext List](kext-list/)
List of all the kexts included... pretty self explanatory.

## [Mach Traps and MIG tables](mach-traps/)
Mach system calls are commonly known as "traps".
At the trap level, the interface to most Mach abstractions consists of messages sent to and from kernel ports representing those objects. The trap-level interfaces (such as `mach_msg_overwrite_trap`) and message formats are themselves abstracted in normal usage by the Mach Interface Generator (MIG). MIG is used to compile procedural interfaces to the message-based APIs, based on descriptions of those APIs.

## [sysctls](sysctls/)
`sysctl` is an interface for examining and dynamically changing parameters in UNIX-like operating systems.

## [UNIX Syscalls](syscalls/)
A system call is the programmatic way in which a computer program requests a service from the kernel of the operating system it is executed on. This may include hardware-related services (for example, accessing a hard disk drive), creation and execution of new processes, and communication with integral kernel services such as process scheduling.
